# Banker's Algorithm
Implementing Banker's Algorithm using C++ in Linux

## Problem at hand

Considering a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. Given a snapshot at time t0: Implement the Banker’s algorithm to answer the following question： Is the system in a safe state? If Yes, then what is the safe sequence?

## Usage
To compile and run, use the following:
```bash

g++ banker.cpp -o banker
./banker

```

## Documentation

The program is designed to handle n processes and m resource types

By keeping the same format, you can add as many processes and resources into input.txt
